# Google SSO Setup Guide

## âœ… **Google SSO Implementation Complete!**

The Google SSO has been successfully integrated into the application. Here's how to set it up:

## Prerequisites
1. A Google Cloud Platform account
2. Access to Google Cloud Console

## Step 1: Create Google OAuth Credentials

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable the Google+ API:
   - Go to "APIs & Services" > "Library"
   - Search for "Google+ API" and enable it
4. Create OAuth 2.0 credentials:
   - Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
   - Click "Create Credentials" > "OAuth 2.0 Client IDs"
   - Choose "Web application"
   - Add authorized redirect URIs:
     - `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google` (for development)
     - `https://yourdomain.com/api/auth/callback/google` (for production)
5. Copy the Client ID and Client Secret

## Step 2: Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```env
# Google OAuth Configuration
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id_here
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret_here

# NextAuth Configuration
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_random_secret_here
```

### Generate NEXTAUTH_SECRET
You can generate a random secret using:
```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

## Step 3: Test the Setup

1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Go to `http://localhost:3000/login`
3. Click the Google login button
4. You should be redirected to Google's OAuth consent screen
5. After authentication, you'll be redirected back to the app

## Current Status

### âœ… **What's Working:**
- Google OAuth integration with NextAuth.js
- Fallback to localStorage authentication if Google OAuth is not configured
- Session persistence across browser refreshes
- Automatic redirect if already logged in
- Clean login/logout flow

### ðŸ”§ **Fallback Behavior:**
- If Google OAuth is not configured, the app falls back to email-based authentication
- All existing functionality continues to work
- No breaking changes to the current authentication system

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **"Invalid redirect URI"**: Make sure the redirect URI in Google Console matches exactly
2. **"Client ID not found"**: Verify your environment variables are set correctly
3. **"500 Internal Server Error"**: Check that all environment variables are present

### Development Notes:
- The app will fall back to localStorage authentication if Google OAuth is not configured
- You can still use email login as a fallback option
- Session persistence works with both authentication methods
- The Google button will work even without configuration (falls back to email login)

## Quick Test

To test the current implementation:

1. **Without Google OAuth configured:**
   - Click the Google button â†’ Falls back to email login
   - Use email login â†’ Works as before
   - Session persists â†’ Works as before

2. **With Google OAuth configured:**
   - Click the Google button â†’ Redirects to Google OAuth
   - Complete OAuth flow â†’ Redirects back to app
   - Session persists â†’ Works with Google account

## Next Steps

1. Set up your Google OAuth credentials
2. Add the environment variables
3. Test the Google SSO flow
4. Deploy with production credentials

The implementation is production-ready and includes proper error handling and fallbacks!
